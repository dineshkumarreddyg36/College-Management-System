Developed a database management system where the admin has the privilege to add or remove students and teachers from the database.
The teacher can mark the attendance of a particular student and can upload marks of the students
to the database.
The Students are given the rights to change their user password, check their attendance, download
their attendance and marks obtained by them for the academic year.
XAMPP was used to host the MySQL database and to interact with the database.
